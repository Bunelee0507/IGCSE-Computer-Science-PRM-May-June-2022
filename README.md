# IGCSE-Computer-Science-PRM-May-June-2022
This is a python file that solves the 3 tasks required in the IGCSE Computer Science (CIE) May/June 2022 pre release material.
The way I've made it work is fairly simple.
The data is entered in 2x1 matrices in order
to provide the most efficiency. 

Variables like offer and oday_tday store 
singular values to assist with data processing.
The code is commented with more explanations.
